# sqlalchemy-challenge
I received help on this assignment from a tutor (mostly with the flask component) and consulted someone who is in the data science field.
I attempted to add extra comments to the lines in the SQL Alchemy section in parts of the code where I received some help to show understanding of the line
The line "query = text(f"SELECT count(station) FROM Measurement")" was obtained from AI help. I was attempting to run that line without text and kept receiving an error
On parts in the Flask code where help was recieived I made sure to understand which each line of the code was doing, so I could accomplish this in future tasks.
